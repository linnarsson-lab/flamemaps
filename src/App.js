        <h1>Icicle and Flame Maps</h1>
        <p><i>Job van der Zwan</i></p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Icicle and flame maps (not to be confused with <a href='http://www.cs.middlebury.edu/~candrews/showcase/infovis_techniques_s16/icicle_plots/icicleplots.html'>icicle plots</a> or <a href='http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html'>flame graphs</a>) are a novel type of plot (as far as we can tell), originally designed at <a href='http://linnarssonlab.org/'>Linnarsson Lab</a> to cope with issues that arose due to having far more raw data to show than available screen resolution. Specifically, they avoid issues of smoothing out information through averaging. In a flame map, the "height" of a bar shows the ratio of zero to non-zero values in that bin. The heat map gradient of the bar shows the actual values. Below you can compare a few <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple'>small multiples</a> of the same data displayed as bar graphs, heat maps, and flame/icicle maps.

          <i>(The data is taken from <a href='http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6226/1138'>"Cell types in the mouse cortex and hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq", A Zeisel, AB Mu√±oz-Manchado, et al. 2015</a>. However, the data itself does not really matter for what we are trying to demonstrate)</i>
        </p>
        <p>As you probably guessed, icicle maps are just upside-down flame maps with a different color scale. Since they are identical otherwise, I will use flame maps as the standard example from now on.</p>
        <h2>Original Scientific Context</h2>
        <p>
          Flame maps were designed to solve a specific problem, and knowing the problem they originally tried to solve may make it easier to understand them.
          </p>
        <p>
          Linnarsson Lab is does research in the field of molecular neurobiology, using <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_cell_sequencing#Single-cell_RNA_sequencing_.28scRNA-seq.29'>Single cell RNA sequencing</a> (scRNAseq). The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children'>lies-to-children</a> explanation of what we do is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Take a sample of cells (the biological kind)</li>
          <li>Measure gene expressions for each cell: <i>"is gene Mog active, is gene Plp1 active, etc."</i>. This is measured by counting RNA levels for that gene.</li>
          <li>Try to identify which genes are associated with which cell type</li>
          <li>Combine this with sampling from different developmental stages to untangle the genetic side of cell development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The idea is identifying cell types by genes (for example, <a href='http://ki.se/en/news/special-nerve-cells-cause-goose-bumps-and-nipple-erection'>new types of neurons</a>) Since we don't know <i>a priori</i> what the relevant genes will be, the number of genes measured is essentially "as much as you can get away with" (typically tens of thousands). Similarly, for purposes of statistical strength, the cell sample size is "as big as you can get away with", which is rapidly increasing in this field: data sets of tens of thousands of cells are common now, hundreds of thousands are starting to pop up and surely a million is not far off.
        </p>
        <p>
          The end result is a data set that is basically a giant table, with columns representing individual cells, rows representing genes, and cells in the table representing how much RNA was measured of that gene in that particular cell. Most of these cells will be zero because the gene is not active - we have a sparse data set.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make sense of the data, clustering algorithms are used to sort the rows and columns of this table, so that similar cells and genes end up close together. The next step is to inspect individual rows of this table for "marker genes" - genes whose activation (or lack thereof) can be used to categorise cell types. That is where these plots come in.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>A crucial point to note here is that unlike most charts, the x-axes of the plots used in this article do not represent a value like time, or clear-cut categories. It's just cells, ordered by "heuristic likeness" (to the best of our cluster algorithm's ability), grouped evenly across available bars.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          So say we use a bar chart to plot a gene row. Each bar is simply a bin taking its portion of our original row. Say we have 100.000 cells, but only 1000 pixels to display them. Even if we make our bars as narrow as a single pixel, they still represent 100 cells, typically by averaging their values.
        </p>
        <h2>Issues introduced by binning and averaging</h2>
        <p>
          Three interactive plots should be displayed below, one bar graph, one heatmap, and one flame map. The plots show levels of gene expression in a selection of mouse cells for a given gene. For heat maps and flame maps, zero values are displayed as white, and non-zero values scale from yellow for low values, to red for high values.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plots should be 800 pixels wide, and for demonstration purposes the width of the bars is at least four pixels. That means they can display at most 200 bars (assuming this is viewed on a display with a high enough resolution. We try to compensate for smaller screens, zoom settings, and high density displays, but it might not be completely right. Apologies, it is very hard to make dynamic plots behave the same across different media).
        </p>
        <p>Try changing the number of plotted cells, while predicting how different amounts of data affect the shape plot itself:</p>
        <IntroDemo amount={introDemoAmount} />
        <p>
          Did you notice the change once the number of cells exceeds {introSetLink(200)}? You may want to increase the value one step at a time to really see the effect. How the graphs change when you wiggle the value around {introSetLink(300)} is also very revealing. And for the sake of completeness, try {introSetLink(2995)} to {introSetLink(3005)}.
        </p>
        <h3>Large relative differences when averaging small bin sizes</h3>
        <p>
          Because our maximum of 200 bars, larger data sets require grouping the data. For the bar graph and heatmap we typically bin the data as evenly as possible, then plot the average value per bin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compare plotting {introSetLink(298)}, {introSetLink(299)}, and {introSetLink(300)} cells. In this range the bar alternate between binning one and two data points. As you can see, a tiny bit of wiggling has a big effect on how the data is distributed. To make matters worse, for bar graphs and heat maps there is no direct visual way of telling how this is done, hiding it from the reader. Admittedly, the data-to-bins ratio here is specifically chosen to maximise that effect, but it illustrates the point.
        </p>
        <h3>Averaging away information</h3>
        <p>
          Often, averaging is a good thing, smoothing away noise and outliers. In our case it can hide useful information. Often it is important to know in <i>how many</i> cells a gene is expressed. In other words: the sparsity of the data. This is a separate thing from the actual value of expression. Averaging reduces these two types of information to one number.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also have noticed that the bar graphs tends to decrease in height with increased bin-size (try Hexb and watch the left values). Because our data is sparse, averaging tends to skew values towards zero. When we have very large data sets, this can even mask non-zero values, although log-scaling the vertical axis helps a bit here.
          </p>
        <p>
          <i>(Aside from using a log-scale, there are more sophisticated alternatives to averaging that can help as well, like <a href='https://skemman.is/handle/1946/15343'>Steinarsson's Largest Triangle Three Buckets algorithm</a>, but they have their own trade-offs)</i>
        </p>
        <h2>How flame maps attempt to address these issues</h2>
        <p>The aforementiond problems are simplified examples of the problems highlighted by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet'>Anscombe's Quartet</a>, or the more recent <a href='https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats'>'Datasaurus Dozen'</a> by Matejka and Fitzmaurice. Like the graphs in these papers, the most straight-forward solution would be representing the raw data being binned.
        </p>
        <h3>Using more space and colour dimensions</h3>
        <p>
          Heat maps (as used here) only use horizontal position and colour, and bar graphs use horizontal position and height (colours usually being limited to grouping data by category). Flame maps use width, height and colour to indicate different things, effectively having one extra "dimension" at their disposal to communicate information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar to how we use bar graphs and heat maps, flame maps group the input data in order, and as evenly as possible across the available bars. However, instead of averaging these values, each bin sorts their values, and plots them a vertical heat map (if we have only one data point per bin, the result is effectively a regular heatmap). The typical look of the plotted gradients gives the flame map its name.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>In a flame map, the "height" of a bar shows the count of non-zero values in that bin. The gradient of the bar gives an impression of the actual values</b> (height is fixed at the biggest bin size, and for bins with less data a grey block signals the missing element).
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, when plotting between {introSetLink(201)} and {introSetLink(400)} cells in the example above, we can immediately see when we are binning two values or one, and what their separate values are. Meg3 is another good example of where this adds information: there is a chunk where nearly all cells are non-zero, but expression level varies. This could not be discerned on the heat map or bar graph.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even when we have more data per column than vertical pixels, and are therefore forced to average data per pixel, this is less of a problem than before: because the data is sorted, the values being averaged are likely to be (nearly) the same value.
        </p>
        <h3>Dealing with very sparse data</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes the data is so sparse that only the bottom bin of a column contains non-zero values. If our bins are only two to four data points high ({introSetLink(400)}, {introSetLink(600)} and {introSetLink(800)} cells in the above demo), these are still readable, but when the data-to-pixel ratio is bigger, we end up with our sparse-data averaging problem again.
        </p>
        <p>For example, in the small multiple that opened the article, each cell has only one or two pixels. With sparse data, this makes non-zero values hard to spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          To compensate for this, flame maps default to adding a thin strip below the main plot, that shows the maximum value of the bin above it. These are separated by a grey line, to avoid confusing this with a higher number of expressed cells:
        </p>
        {
          showIcicle ? (
            <SplashIcicle
              key='emphNZ_icicle'
              width={70}
              pixelScale={1}
              settings={{ logScale: true, emphasizeNonZero: splashEmphNZ }} />
          ) : (
              <SplashFlame
                key='emphNZ_flame'
                width={70}
                pixelScale={1}
                settings={{ logScale: true, emphasizeNonZero: splashEmphNZ }} />
            )
        }
        <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
          <label style={{ flex: 150, margin: '10px 25px 10px 25px' }}>
            <Checkbox
              defaultChecked={1}
              checked={splashEmphNZ ? 1 : 0}
              onChange={this.handleEmphNZ} />
            <span>&nbsp;emphasize non-zero</span>
          </label>
          <button
            style={{ flex: 150, margin: '10px 25px 10px 25px' }}
            onClick={this.handleIcicle}>
            {showIcicle ? <span>Heatmap/<b>Icicle</b></span> : <span><b>Heatmap</b>/Icicle</span>}
          </button>
        </div>
        <p>
          For very sparse data, the extra strip makes the presence of non-zero values stand out.
        </p>
        <h2>Caveats of using flame maps</h2>
        <p>
          We do not want to suggest that flame maps are a drop-in replacement for bar charts and heatmaps. They have their own trade-offs and potential issues.
        </p>
        <h3>Simpler alternatives</h3>
        <p>
          Even when showing sparsity and preventing deceptive averages is important, there might be simpler alternatives. When that is <i>all</i> that we want to know, we can also sort the data as a whole, instead of per column, which is an easier to interpret visual solution:
        </p>
        <SortedPlots />
        <p>
          However, when the order of data matters this is not an option. In our case, we want to compare clusters of cells, so regardless of which order we choose, it has to stay constant across plots.
        </p>
        <h3>Aliasing issues</h3>
        <p>
          An underlying assumption for flame maps is that slightly displacing cells locally is not a problem, letting us get away with sorting the data by value in each column. This might not alwys be the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, aliasing issues are still problematic. Below are two artificial data sets that demonstrate this. Both alternate between on and off, but they might do so at different offsets. You can tweak the values yourself explore what kind of aliasing issues can arise:
        </p>
        <AlternatingPlots />
        <p>
          As you can see, the data only really makes sense when we zoom in far enough that each cell is plotted separately. However, bar graphs and heat maps perform just as poorly. We suspect that in any situation where sorting is a significant issue, averaging is just as bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cause of the problem here is not really the type of plot being used, it is the underlying ordering. If something like this would show up in a real data set, the problem is likely either the choice of algorithm that lead to said ordering, or the data itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point however is that, unlike the issues caused by sparsity or averaging, flame maps are just as susceptible to this as bar graphs and heat maps.
        </p>
        <h3>Imprecision of colour comparisons</h3>
        <p>If we want to determine how much two values differ, human perception is less precise when comparing colours than when comparing sizes. Ignoring the aforementioned issues with averaging, flame maps and heat maps both have a disadvantage over bar charts here.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, for anything that requires more precise interpretations than comparing zero-values, low non-zero values, and high non-zero values, we advise against using flame maps (or heat maps). Providing more fine-grained controls like clipping, tresholding and log-scaling the data may also help.
        </p>
        <h3>Optical illusions</h3>
        <p>
          It is plausible that certain colour gradient arrangements can lead to optical illusions, like the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_effect'>simultaneous contrast effect</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_bands'>Mach bands</a>, and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercolour_illusion'>watercolour illusion</a>. Similarly, the optical illusions related to perceived sizes being affected by nearby sizes are well documented - i.e. the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebbinghaus_illusion'>Ebbinghaus illusion</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This could interfere with the correct interpretation of the underlying data. Of course, both heat maps and bar graphs would also be susceptible to these types of illusions, but since flame maps combine size and colour they might be more susceptible to them, or suffer from novel illusions that arise from the combination. However, we have not really looked into this, so this is purely speculative.
        </p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>When compared to traditional bar graphs and heat maps, due to not averaging grouped data, flame maps let us:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>discern whether grouped data contain many low values, or a few high values</li>
          <li>discern the ratio zero to non-zero values</li>
          <li>spot the presence of non-zero values when data is extremely sparse</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In situations where these are desired properties, and a very precise distinction between high and low values is not required, we think they will provide advantages.</p>
        <p>
          They are, in our opinion, very simple to construct, to the point where we are still not sure if they are really novel or if we simply have not looked hard enough. If they do already exist under another name, and with implementations in major plotting packages, please let us know. It would make the people in our group very happy (see below).
        </p>
        <h2>Implementations</h2>
        <p><i>
          I'll switch to first person here, because this is a WIP. For now, you're basically looking at the only implementation. Sorry. The source code for this website be found at:

        <p><i>
          Flame maps were created for a for-now in-house web app. For performance reasons they were implemented in raw javascript and html5 canvas (not even a framework like d3.js was used). This demo page is based on repurposed plotting code from this web app. I do not know PyPlot, R or any other plotting library really, and currently don't have the time it would take to learn them well enough to implement these plots efficiently. So I figured it made more sense to write a convincing demonstration page and hope that  others will agree these plots are useful, in the hope that the various plotting library wizards out there take over from there. And then Gioele can stop wishing I'll learn how to use PyPlot to implement this for him - Job
